//! The global, per-user preferences persisted as `settings.json` in the data
//! directory. This is the growing home for usagi's configurable behaviour; it
//! currently carries only the UI [`Theme`], with more settings added as the
//! features that consume them land (per-project overrides and the settings store
//! come later).
//!
//! Enum-valued settings degrade an unrecognised stored token to a sensible
//! default rather than failing the whole file, so a value written by a newer
//! usagi — or a hand-edited typo — never blocks loading. [`Theme`] does this with
//! `#[serde(other)]` on [`Theme::System`] (unknown → follow the OS).
