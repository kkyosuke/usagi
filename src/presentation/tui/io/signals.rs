//! Terminal-restoring signal handlers for the interactive TUI.
//!
//! The RAII guards ([`AlternateScreenGuard`](super::screen::AlternateScreenGuard)
//! and the embedded pane's mode guard) reset the terminal — leave the alternate
//! screen, disable mouse reporting, show the cursor — when they drop on a normal
//! return or a panic unwind. A signal that terminates the process
//! (SIGINT / SIGTERM / SIGHUP) runs no destructors, so without these handlers the
//! shell is left with mouse reporting still on: every pointer move then echoes a
//! `\x1b[<btn;x;yM` report as visible garbage. The classic trigger is Ctrl-C
//! under `cargo run` landing in the sliver of time the TUI is not holding raw
//! mode (so `console` does not translate it to `Key::CtrlC`) — a real SIGINT
//! kills usagi before any `Drop` runs — but `kill` (SIGTERM) and closing the
//! terminal / SSH session (SIGHUP) skip the guards the same way.
//!
//! [`install`] registers a handler for those three signals. It writes the shared
//! [`TERMINAL_RESTORE`](super::screen::TERMINAL_RESTORE) sequence straight to the
//! stdout fd and restores the pre-TUI line discipline, then re-raises the signal
//! so the process still dies with the signal's normal semantics. Everything the
//! handler does is async-signal-safe: a raw `write(2)`, a `tcsetattr(2)` to a
//! termios captured before the TUI started, and `raise(3)` — no allocation, no
//! lock, no Rust `Drop`.
