//! The agent port: the single interface usagi drives every agent CLI through.
//!
//! usagi needs a handful of things from whatever agent it launches — chiefly how
//! to start it (with usagi's MCP servers and lifecycle hooks wired in). Rather
//! than scatter per-CLI `match`es across the codebase, those needs are gathered
//! into the [`Agent`] trait (the port).
//! One adapter per CLI implements it in `infrastructure::agent`, and
//! `infrastructure::agent::agent_for` is the single place that maps an
//! [`AgentCli`](crate::domain::settings::AgentCli) setting to its adapter —
//! adding a new agent is one new adapter plus one arm there.
//!
//! This module is pure domain: the trait and the [`AgentWiring`] policy it is
//! handed. How that policy is rendered into a CLI's invocation lives in the
//! adapters (the infrastructure layer).
